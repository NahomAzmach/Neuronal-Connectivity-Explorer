This is a lightweight, AI-enhanced web application for visualizing mouse brain connectivity using data from the [Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas](https://connectivity.brain-map.org). It allows users to explore neuronal projections from a given brain region and receive concise, AI-generated insights on neural function and circuitry.

Built using Python, Flask, Plotly, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT API, this project reflects my ongoing interest in building accessible scientific tools that translate large biological datasets into usable knowledge.

## Why This Project?

Across multiple academic and personal projects, Iâ€™ve found immense value in making complex datasets â€” from infrared spectroscopy and protein structures to rental markets â€” both **explorable** and **understandable**.

This project continues that theme by transforming connectivity data into interactive visualizations and interpretable summaries. It reflects my belief that tools should not just present information â€” they should **guide insight**, **improve accessibility**, and **support exploration** across a range of users.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**  
  Bar charts, heatmaps, and network graphs make it easy to compare projection strengths between brain regions.

    <img src="static/images/networkMap.png" alt="Network Graph" width="45%">
  </div>

- **AI-Generated Tooltips**  
  Uses OpenAI GPT to generate concise 1â€“2 sentence descriptions of mouse brain regions, cached locally via SQLite.

- **Natural Language Query Interface**  
  Users can type questions like _"Why does this area project to the thalamus?"_ and receive context-aware answers.

- **Modular, Reusable Backend Components**  
  Code is structured for easy reuse in other biological or anatomical datasets.

- **Local Caching System**  
  Caches AI responses to reduce API use and improve performance.

## Project Philosophy

This project embodies a theme common to much of my work: **taking complex scientific or real-world data and turning it into systems people can interact with**.

From visualizing protein behavior with ROSETTA to scraping real-time rental data and building property filtering tools with React and Leaflet, Iâ€™ve consistently gravitated toward building tools that bridge the gap between raw data and practical decision-making.

## Example Use Case

**A user inputs the ID of a brain structure (e.g., hippocampus) and receives:**

* Visual projections to other regions
* Functional explanations of each region
* AI-generated insight into the structure's role and network connectivity

**They can ask questions like:**

"What is this structureâ€™s function?"
"Why is it connected to the thalamus?"
"What kind of circuits does this pattern suggest?"

**Rental Property Aggregator (AWS-Backed, Full Stack)**
Identified a local housing pain point and built a scalable solution:
A Node.js/React-based platform that consolidates listings from two major rental websites into a single, user-friendly interface.

**Key features include:**

- Real-time filtering by price and location
- Interactive map visualization with Leaflet
- Cloud migration to AWS EC2, with DynamoDB for scalable storage of property listings
- Automatically updates listing data on schedule using headless scraping tools and AWS EventBridge
- This project reflects my passion for turning fragmented, big datasets into tools that support transparency, accessibility, and better decision-making.

## About Me
Iâ€™m a computer science upcoming graduate with strong interests in scientific computing, data accessibility, and front-end/backend tool development. I love projects that turn big, messy datasets into interactive, elegant systems â€” especially when they support real-world exploration, equity, and discovery. I have also recieved a minor in Biology and Chemistry.
